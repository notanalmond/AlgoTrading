# Neural Networks For Market Trading

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `NN_ForTrading.ipynb` that demonstrates the use of neural networks and other machine learning techniques to predict market trends based on historical trading data. The notebook was developed in Google Colab and is designed to process and analyze financial market data to identify potential trading signals.

## Overview

The notebook is structured to process data from the EURUSD currency pair, covering the period from May 2003 to June 2021. It involves data cleaning, exploration, and the development of trading strategies based on technical indicators.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensures that the data is free of anomalies and zeros in volume, which can skew analysis.
- **Support and Resistance Detection**: Implements functions to identify key technical levels which are crucial for setting up trades.
- **Engulfing and Star Patterns**: Identifies important candlestick patterns that are often indicators of potential market reversals.
- **Trading Signal Generation**: Combines technical indicators with candlestick patterns to generate buy and sell signals.
- **Backtesting**: Utilizes the `backtesting.py` library to simulate trading performance based on the signals generated by the model.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- backtesting.py
- xgboost
- sklearn
- pandas_ta

You can install these packages using pip:
